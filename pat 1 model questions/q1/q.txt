PAT-1 Model Question – Enterprise-Level HTML & CSS Design with Frameset-style Layout (15 Marks)
A multinational food-tech company “CuisineCloud” is rebuilding its legacy cloud-kitchen dashboard, which was originally implemented using an HTML <frameset> layout. The new version must visually preserve the old three-panel “framed” layout while using HTML5 semantic elements and CSS-based layout techniques instead of the obsolete <frameset> tag. Each cuisine category must behave as an independent content unit and appear in the main content area, while navigation and recommendations are shown in side panels.
The legacy layout is conceptually divided as:
•	Top horizontal frame: Company branding and navigation.
•	Left vertical frame: High-level cuisine navigation shortcuts.
•	Center frame: Cuisine sections and food item cards.
•	Right vertical frame: Chef’s recommendations.
The new design must simulate this multi-frame layout using modern HTML5 and CSS (e.g., CSS Grid or Flexbox) and then present the final output as a single integrated figure of the rendered page.
