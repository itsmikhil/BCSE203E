Design the HTML structure of the GastroGrid web page without using <frameset>,
 but logically preserving the old framed layout, under these constraints:
•	Use <header> at the top “frame” to display:
•	Company name.
•	A tagline using an emphasis-related text element (e.g., <em>).
•	Create a global <nav> bar inside or directly under the header with anchor links that scroll to each cuisine 
category within the same page (e.g., #indian, #italian, #asian).
•	Use a main layout container (e.g., <main>) that is visually divided into three “
frame-like” regions using semantic elements:
•	A left navigation panel (e.g., <nav> or <aside>) containing a vertical list of 
cuisine shortcuts.
•	A central content area using <section> elements, where each cuisine category is a 
<section> and each food item inside it is an <article>.
•	A right recommendation panel using <aside> that highlights “Chef’s Recommendation” 
with at least two dishes.
•	Each food item <article> must include:
•	Dish name using a heading element.
•	Short description using <p>.
•	Price using an appropriate text element (e.g., <span> or <p> with a class).
•	Use <footer> at the bottom to display copyright information.
Marks are awarded for correct use of semantic elements, logical nesting, 
and a layout that clearly resembles a multi-frame structure while remaining HTML5-compliant.
