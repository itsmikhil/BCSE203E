Explain and demonstrate, using CSS, how the box model is applied to the food item cards in the central “frame”:
•	Show how padding is used inside each .food-card to create comfortable internal spacing between the border and the content (dish name, description, price).
•	Show how margin or layout gaps are used to control the distance between adjacent cards so they do not visually collide.
•	Show how a border is used to define the boundaries of each card and help separate it from the coloured background of its cuisine section.
